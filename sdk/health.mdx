# `health`

Lightweight liveness probe for your Kaizen deployment.

## Description
- Sends `GET /` to the configured `base_url`.
- Useful for readiness checks in containers, CI pipelines, or diagnostics before kicking off workloads.

## Code example
```python
async with KaizenClient.from_env() as client:
    status = await client.health()
    print(status)
```

## Response example
```json
{
  "operation": "health",
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime": 123456,
  "region": "us-east-1"
}
```

## Errors
- `401` → API key missing or invalid.
- `503` → Deployment temporarily unavailable; retry with backoff.

## Notes
- The exact payload fields (`uptime`, `region`, etc.) may vary by deployment. Treat anything beyond `status` as informational.
- Health checks bypass compression logic, so they’re safe to call from cold-start scripts before setting up workloads.
