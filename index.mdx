# Kaizen SDKs

Compress prompts, reduce latency, and decode large-model responses using the **Kaizen Token Optimized Format (KTOF)**. This repository hosts the official Kaizen clients—starting with Python—plus documentation, schemas, and usage examples.

> Status: The Python SDK is production-ready. JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and CLI tooling are planned for upcoming releases.\
> Benchmark Program: Interested in evaluating prompt compression or latency optimization across LLM providers? Contact [**hello@getkaizen.ai**](mailto:hello@getkaizen.ai) to join the testing cohort.

## Why Kaizen?

- Reduce token usage and lower costs through compression of prompts and responses
- Consistent API surface across languages with OpenAPI-based SDKs
- Seamless wrappers for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and other LLM providers
- Transparent observability: track compression ratios, token savings, and metadata
- Multi-tenant SaaS and enterprise deployment options available
